# Digital Clock Project

This is a project for Digital Electronics where I built a Digital Clock using Vivado, which programs a Basys3 Board. The project was a collaborative effort with my partner, Karan Pattanaik.

## Description

The Digital Clock project showcases various functionalities by leveraging the Basys3 FPGA board and Verilog programming within the Vivado software environment. Below are the main features implemented in this project:

- **Clock:** Displays the current time on a 7-segment display, with the ability to set the time.
- **Stopwatch:** Measures time in seconds and milliseconds, featuring start, stop, and pause functionalities.
- **Timer:** Can be set to a specific number of minutes and seconds. An LED blinks when the time elapses.
- **Alarm:** Can be set for specific hours and minutes. An LED blinks for 1 minute when the set time is reached.

## Features

- **Clock:**
  - Time displayed on a 7-segment display.
  - Adjustable time settings.
- **Stopwatch:**
  - Displays time in seconds and milliseconds.
  - Start, stop, and pause functionalities.
- **Timer:**
  - Set to a specified number of minutes and seconds.
  - LED blinks when the timer completes.
- **Alarm:**
  - Set for specific hours and minutes.
  - LED blinks for 1 minute when the alarm time is reached.
